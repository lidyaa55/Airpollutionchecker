# Overview

This project is an interactive map application that displays real-time air quality data and weather information for various cities in Ethiopia. The purpose of this project is to enhance my skills in working with APIs, integrating data, and creating user-friendly web applications. The software fetches air quality data from the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API and weather details from the OpenWeatherMap API.

The map shows 20 markers, each representing a city in Ethiopia. Clicking on a marker opens a popup with the city's air quality index (AQI), temperature, and humidity. This project provided a great opportunity to explore mapping libraries and work with live data.
